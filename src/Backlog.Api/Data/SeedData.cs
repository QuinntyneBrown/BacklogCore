You may even supervise others. However, you are likely to need to seek advice before carrying out more complex or non-standard tasks.

If you are working at an Accomplished level of competence you will have the knowledge and experience to carry out complex, specialist or non-standard tasks confidently and consistently. You will be aware of alternative approaches and can provide guidance, instruction and advice on the activity to others.

If you are at the Authoritative level of competence you will be widely recognised as an authority, both by others in your organisation and by external peers, for the knowledge and experience you demonstrate.
